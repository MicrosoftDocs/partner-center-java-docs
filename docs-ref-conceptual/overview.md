# Overview

The Partner Center Java SDK provides an SDK to interact with Microsoft's Partner Center service. This enables the partners to perform the Partner Center operations programmatically. The Java SDK supports Java version 8 or later. It is an open source project maintained by the partner community. Since this module is maintained by the partner community, it is not officially supported by Microsoft. You can [get help from the community](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=partner+center) or open an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/partner-center-java/issues) on GitHub.

## Client library

Manage resources in Partner Center using the client library.

[Add a dependency](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#How_do_I_use_external_dependencies) to your Maven `pom.xml` file to use the client library in your project.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.store</groupId>
    <artifactId>partnercenter</artifactId>
    <version>1.14.0</version>
</dependency>
```
